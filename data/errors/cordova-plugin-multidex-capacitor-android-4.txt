        WARNING:DSL element 'dexOptions' is obsolete and should be removed.
        It will be removed in version 8.0 of the Android Gradle plugin.
        Using it has no effect, and the AndroidGradle plugin optimizes dexing automatically.
        WARNING:Using flatDir should be avoided because it doesn't support any meta-data formats.
