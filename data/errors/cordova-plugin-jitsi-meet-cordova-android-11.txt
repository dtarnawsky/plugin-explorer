/Users/damian/Sample Code/plugin-explorer/apps/cordova/platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml Error:
	uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 22 cannot be smaller than version 23 declared in library [org.jitsi.react:jitsi-meet-sdk:3.5.4] /Users/damian/.gradle/caches/transforms-3/1e15ac7b94390c0b69d8cc3d6f85de6e/transformed/jetified-jitsi-meet-sdk-3.5.4/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 22
	Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 22,
		or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 23,
		or use tools:overrideLibrary="org.jitsi.meet.sdk" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)
